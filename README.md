# telegramm_chatbot_reminder
Reminder chat bot for telegram that will help you not to forget some important things
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I'm just trying to write a simple bot, nothing more!))</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
Don't forget to install dep's by using:
```
npm install  
```
1. You need to have a simple chat bot in telegramm messenger
2. Put into index.js file your telegramm bot token (you can find where ;D)
3. Run our code in terminal:
```
node index.js  
```
Now you can communicate with the bot using a simple syntax construction:
```
/remembermeplz (your_text (like --to drink beer with friends--)) at (your_time (like --10.22--))
```
Example:
```
/remembermeplz to drink beer with friends at 10.22
```
And that's all! GL and HF)
